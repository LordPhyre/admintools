# admintools
A Minetest mod that adds cool tools for Admins and stuff.
The textures are based on 3d_armor's Admin Armor, and yes, I did steal the colors.


The Admin Sword allows you to insta-kill and break tree leaves very fast.
The Admin MultiTool is just that, a MultiTool, and it allows you to break any type of block very speedily.
[Coming Soon!]
