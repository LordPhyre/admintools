# admintools
## A Minetest mod that adds cool tools for Admins and stuff.

#### List of features:
The Admin Sword allows you to insta-kill people and break tree leaves instantly.

The Admin MultiTool is just that, a MultiTool, and it allows you to break ANY type of block instantly!

The Magic Stick is a really cool item (with an equally cool texture) that allows you to smack people 20-30 blocks and launch yourself into the air! (With zero lag!)

The Barrier Block is a Minecraft inspired item that adds an *almost* unbreakable and completely invisible node. Usefull for stuff.

The Burning Air is a invisible fire-like node that cannot be seen or directly broken and does damage. The only way to get rid of it is to place another block on it.

I've incorperated the spectator_mode mod (https://github.com/minetest-mods/spectator_mode) because it's really useful to detect cheaters.
