# admintools
A Minetest mod that adds cool tools for Admins and stuff.
The textures are based on 3d_armor's Admin Armor, and yes, I did steal the colors.


The Admin Sword allows you to insta-kill people and break tree leaves instantly.

The Admin MultiTool is just that, a MultiTool, and it allows you to break ANY type of block instantly!

The Magic Stick is a really cool item (with an equally cool texture) that allows you to smack people 20-30 blocks as well as shoot yourself up into the air!
(No lag bros)

The Knockback Stick is a common peasant's version of the Magic Stick. It does less damage and cannot act upon the user.

The Barrier Block is a Minecraft inspired item that adds an *almost* unbreakable and completely invisible node. Usefull for stuff.

The Burning Air is a invisible fire-like node that cannot be seen or directly broken and does damage. The only way to get rid of it is to place another block on it.

[Coming Soon!]
