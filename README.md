# admintools
A Minetest mod that adds cool tools for Admins and stuff.
The textures are based on 3d_armor's Admin Armor, and yes, I did steal the colors.


The Admin Sword allows you to insta-kill and break tree leaves instantly.

The Admin MultiTool is just that, a MultiTool, and it allows you to break ANY type of block instantly!

The Magic Stick is a really cool item (with an equally cool texture) that allows you to smack people 20-30 blocks as well as shoot yourself up into the air!
(No lag bros)

[Coming soon]
